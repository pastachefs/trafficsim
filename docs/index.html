              Traffic Simulator (TrafficSim) is a virtual reality driving simulator developed for Dr. Ghazan Khan from the Sacramento State Civil Engineering department and his research team to help gather data from users about their driving habits
              and driving reactions under different road conditions. This project has the long term goal of assisting Dr. Khan’s team with the development of better, safer roads for everyday citizens by determining which conditions help the average
              driver practice good habits and which conditions encourage undesirable behaviors. TrafficSim shall provide value to Dr. Khan in the form of an accurate and immersive virtual reality driving simulation that will record behavioral data
              for graduate students. This behavior data can then be studied for the purpose of statistical analysis.

            <h3>Highlight of the Project</h3>
            <p>
              While such simulation tools already exist without virtual reality, they either do not provide an immersive or accurate enough
              simulation to be of meaningful use or are too expensive and impractical to be considered by the department. Through the use of virtual reality, this project will prove to be a more cost-effective and practical tool for his team’s
              research, while maintaining the realism of a more expensive research simulation environment.

          <section id="map-editor">
            <h3>Map Editor (<a target="_blank" href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/8X0yln5mzWXjRA3P7ItXON/Prototype-A?node-id=9%3A3&scaling=min-zoom">Figma</a>)</h3>
            <p>
              Our group has expanded on the map editor by:
            <ul>
              <li>Adding stop signs, traffic lights, and construction/school zone signs</li>
              <li>Allowing the user to save their custom map</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="traffic-control">
            <h3>Traffic Control (<a target="_blank" href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/YHj6v2e9TKxjhriVWpU6Y9/Prototype-B?node-id=17%3A2&scaling=min-zoom">Figma</a>)</h3>
            <p>
              Originally, the simulator only had the ability to place individual vehicles in the map. Our group has added the ability to set spawn points where vehicles can spawn and the user is able to modify the spawn rate.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="weather">
            <h3>Weather Conditions (<a target="_blank" href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/R9dOJUwHWYqjOIgQZGzzSL/Prototype-C?scaling=min-zoom&node-id=1%3A3">Figma</a>)</h3>
            <p>
              The simulator currently has no weather mechanics, with the road conditions being dry the entire time. Our group has expanded upon this by beginning work on:
            <ul>
              <li>Implementing a slider in the settings to change the weather to rainy/foggy in real time</li>
              <li>Adding road glare that inhibits the driver's vision</li>
              <li>Adding rainy/foggy blocks of road in the map editor</li>
            </ul>
              Due to time constraints, the weather feature has not been completed. However, we have included documentation for future groups to continue implementing this feature.
            </p>

          <section id="pedestrian">
            <h3>Pedestrian Behavior (<a target="_blank" href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/OCSkfT1JsON4AwWia5WDjf/Prototype-D?node-id=1%3A3&scaling=min-zoom">Figma</a>)</h3>
            <p>
              The original behavior of pedestrians is to continuously walk in a straight path. Our group has modified the behavior of the pedestrian AI allowing the user to modify the pedestrian's path so that the pedestrian walks in a pre-defined path.

            <p>
              Originally, the simulator only has 6 settings to modify the car’s behavior. In addition to modifying the car’s turning physics to make the simulator more realistic, our group has extended upon the car settings by:
            <ul>
              <li>Beginning the implementation of traction control</li>
              <li>Implementing a text field to set the acceleration delay</li>
              <li>Implementing fuel consumption rate</li>
              <li>Beginning the implementation of a slider to modify the car’s handling</li>
            </ul>
            Our group has also finished implementing the fuel capacity/level since the car originally does not consume fuel while running and will continue to run even when the current fuel level is set to zero.
